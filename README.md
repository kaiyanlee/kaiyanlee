# Hello :penguin:

My name is Kaiyan M. Lee and I am a self-taught computer programmer and digital designer. I specialize in building modern applications and websites that are fast, efficient, and attractive. As a fullstack developer I can use my frontend and backend knowledge to improve code synergy.

I love open-source communities, tools, and technologies. My favorite design tools are all open-source: Inkscape, Krita, and Blender. The same could be said of my favorite programming languages: Go, C/C++, and Typescript. My favorite frameworks and ecosystems are ReactJS and Qt â€” though I am more experienced with the latter.

You can learn more about me by visiting my [website](https://kaiyanlee.github.io).
