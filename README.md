# Hello :penguin:

My name is Kaiyan M. Lee and I am a software developer.

I love open-source communities, tools, and technologies. My favorite design tools are all open-source: Inkscape, Krita, and Blender. The same could be said of my favorite programming languages: Go, C/C++, and Typescript.

You can learn more about me by visiting my [website](https://kaiyanlee.github.io).
